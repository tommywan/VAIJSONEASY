This is my easy way to show customers how to use webhooks to GET values from a DB and use them as custom parameters in VAI. You can use the DB to update the parameters mapped in VAI as well. 

Feel free to take the DB for your own use. Please create your OWN values and map them in your VAI webhook. 

Create your parameters in the studio and use the "$" in the studio to map your custom parameters. 

Remember to check a customer's proficiency before showing them this.
